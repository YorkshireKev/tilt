#Tilt - Device orientation demo#

Inspired by a nostalgic look back at the 16bit demo scene of the late 1980's. This is my little tribute to those classic Atari ST and Commodore Amiga demos.

Only html5 web standards are used, so no need for flash or any such nonsense. It does require a fairly modern browser though. I've tested with Chrome and Firefox, but as I only have a Chromebook that sports an accelerometer I don't know if the tilting works in Firefox.

You don't need to clone the repo locally if you only want to run the demo. Just point your browser at: [http://www.kevssite.com/tilt](http://www.kevssite.com/tilt)
